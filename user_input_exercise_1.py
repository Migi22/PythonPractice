# Exercise 1 Calculate the rectangle area

print("This is a exercise for the lessons i learned so far.")

# user inputs
length = float(input("What is the length of the rectangle? "))
width = float(input("What is the width of the rectangle? "))

# calculation
Area = length*width

# output
print(f"Solving the Area of the rectangle by width multiply by length\n"
      f"so the Area of the rectangle is {Area}cmÂ²")
